Bindings for Linear Technologies LT3593 LED controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "lltc,lt3593".

The hardware supports only one LED. The properties of this LED are
configured in a sub-node in the device node.

Required sub-node properties:
- gpios:	A handle to the GPIO that is connected to the 'CTRL'
		pin of the chip.

Optional sub-node properties:
- label:	A label for the LED. If none is given, the LED will be
		named "lt3595::".
- linux,default-trigger: The default trigger for the LED.
			See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- default-state:	The initial state of the LED.
			See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

If multiple chips of this type are found in a design, each one needs to
be handled by its own device node.

Example:

led-controller {
	compatible = "lltc,lt3593";

	led {
		label = "white:backlight";
		gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		default-state = "on";
	};
};
